Odysseus Linux Setup
====================

This is just a helpful utility to fix any issues that may come up when trying to use Odysseus for Linux. This has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04.2 and Mint.


How to use:
===========
<pre>./OdysseusSetup.sh</pre>

* Note: Odysseus only works on 64bit distros of Linux.
