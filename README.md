Odysseus Linux Setup
====================

This is just a helpful utility to fix any issues that may come up when trying to use Odysseus for Linux. This has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04.2 and Mint. You can download the compiled version [here](http://t.co/3V2b0kNZhM).

Run with sudo.

* Note: Odysseus only works on 64bit distros of Linux.
